  <h3>FAQs</h3>
  <details>
    <summary>How often should cooling pads be replaced?</summary>
    <p>For heavy usage, replacing pads before summer (March–April) is ideal. Honeycomb pads typically last 1–2 seasons, while wood wool pads last 1 season.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Why does cooling reduce with hard water?</summary>
    <p>Mineral deposits clog the pads, causing uneven water distribution. Anti-scale cleaning and pad replacement restore performance.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What causes excessive noise in coolers?</summary>
    <p>It may be due to fan imbalance, worn motor bearings, belt tension issues (in ducted coolers), or loose body panels. Proper inspection and alignment fix these issues.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How are service charges calculated?</summary>
    <p>Basic inspection/diagnosis has a nominal fee. Consumables (pads, pumps, capacitors, wheels, etc.) and specific repairs are charged separately after estimate approval.</p>
